NAME

Date::Day - Perl extension for converting a date to its respective day.

SYNOPSIS

  use Date::Day;

  ## The following will print the weekday corresponding 
  ## to the date March 11, 1998.  

  $result = &day(03,11,1998);
  print "$result";

DESCRIPTION

After noticing the complexity of some modules for determining the day of a 
specific date, I decided to write this module. It is by far the shortest 
module of its kind performing the above task. This module exports a 
subroutine called day() which takes as arguments numerical month, day, and 
year. See Synopsis for example. As far as range of usage, the day() 
function will return a proper day for all dates starting from year 0 
through infinity. There are no restrictions. If you pass bad data to the 
function, a day will still be returned, it just won't have any meaning. So 
March 45, 2001 will return a day, just one with no meaning. So make sure 
you pass real dates.
